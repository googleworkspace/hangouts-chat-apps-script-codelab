# Attendance Bot: Hangouts Chat bot with Apps Script codelab

This code sample demonstrates how to build a Hangouts Chat bot using Google
Apps Script. The bot responds to messages in a room or direct message (DM) and
allows the user to set a vacation responder in Gmail or add an all-day event to
their Calendar from hangouts Chat.

## Usage

You can follow [this codelab]()
to build and test this bot.

To use this bot, you must enable the Hangouts Chat API in the
[Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). After enabling
the API, configuring the bot, and publishing it, you must add the bot to a room
or DM to begin a conversation.

For more information about how to publish a bot, see
[Publishing bots](https://developers.google.com/hangouts/chat/how-tos/bots-publish).
